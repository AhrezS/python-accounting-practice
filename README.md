# Python Accounting Practice: Trial Balance Challenge and more

This project simulates journal entries and generates a trial balance for a fictional business using Python. It also exports the results to an Excel spreadsheet using `openpyxl`. I will be adding more projects in this file that will pertain to the subject of accounting.

## Features

- Journal entries stored as tuples and lists
- Account balances calculated using dictionaries
- Trial balance auto-generated
- Output exported to Excel (`Trial_Balance_June_2025.xlsx`)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code
- openpyxl (Excel automation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required package:  
   `pip install openpyxl`
3. Run the script:  
   `python journal_challenge.py`

## Future Goals

- Add full financial statements
- Build user input support
- Link to GUI or web interface

This is part of a larger learning roadmap to master accounting with Python.
