# Accounting Data Types Example

account_name = "Cash"
balance = 17000             # int
interest_rate = 0.025   # float
is_active = True        # bool

print("Account:", account_name)
print("Balance:", balance)
print("Interest Rate:", interest_rate)
print("Account Active?", is_active)

# Basic Math
interest_earned = balance * interest_rate
print("Interest Earned:", interest_earned)
